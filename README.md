# Gradient Descent Variations for Linear Regression
## Description
This repository contains implementations of three different gradient descent variations for both linear regression and logistic regression models. The variations include:
- Batch Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Mini-batch Gradient Descent
## Installation
To use the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you can install the required packages using pip.

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Each gradient descent variation is implemented as a separate Python script. You can run these scripts to see how each algorithm performs on a sample dataset.

## Running the code

```bash
  python batch_gradient_descent.py
```
Similarly, you can run the other variations:

```bash
  python stochastic_gradient_descent.py
  python mini_batch_gradient_descent.py
```
